## Notes

The biggest challenge I encountered was understanding how Xcode's UI works. At first, I was a little overwhelmed by the IDE, but then I found myself easily getting accustomed to it. The control dragging was very nice, and the visual coding reminded me of [Webflow](https://webflow.com) which made me feel more confident since I am used to web development and have experimented with Webflow before. Overall, it was a new experience, and I really enjoy the Swift language (based solely on my limited exposure) and am getting accustomed to the Xcode IDE.
